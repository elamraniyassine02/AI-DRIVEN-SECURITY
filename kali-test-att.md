Great, you're now at the **testing and validation** phase of your AI-driven SOC/SIEM project! You want to simulate **threats and risks** to test all components (log collection, threat detection, anomaly detection, risk scoring, compliance, alerts, dashboards, etc.).

Here’s a comprehensive, step-by-step plan—**including specific attack/threat scenarios and risk injections**, mapped to your platform's data views and analytics. Each test is designed to exercise and validate one or more parts of your end-to-end security pipeline.

---

## **1. Simulated Attack & Threat Scenarios**

For each test, I’ll specify:

* **Scenario & Technique**
* **How to execute it (command, script, or manual action)**
* **What should be detected or logged**
* **Expected validation in Kibana dashboards/data views**

---

### **A. Brute Force SSH Login Attempt**

**Scenario:** Simulate an attacker trying to brute-force SSH credentials on Worker VM 1.

**How to execute:**

```bash
# From another machine (not Worker 1), run:
hydra -l ubuntu -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.43.187
```

*Or manually attempt several failed SSH logins via `ssh ubuntu@192.168.43.187` with the wrong password repeatedly.*

**What should be logged:**

* `/var/log/auth.log` will record many "Failed password" and "Invalid user" events.

**Expected in Kibana:**

* **Raw Log Events (Filebeat/Auditbeat):** See failed login attempts.
* **Anomaly Detections (AI/ML):** Detect spikes/anomalies in authentication failures.
* **Log Analysis Results:** Pattern for `ssh_login_failure` (even if previously no match).
* **Security Notifications & Alerts:** (If alerting configured) notification of brute force attempt.
* **Cyber Risk Scores:** Risk score for the asset increases.
* **Security Notifications & Alerts:** Should log suspicious activity.

---

### **B. Sudo Abuse / Privilege Escalation**

**Scenario:** Simulate a user running a series of sudo commands.

**How to execute:**

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do sudo ls /root; sleep 1; done
```

**What should be logged:**

* `/var/log/auth.log` and `/var/log/syslog` record sudo session opens/closes.

**Expected in Kibana:**

* **Log Analysis Results:** Pattern `sudo_command` matched and clustered.
* **Anomaly Detections (AI/ML):** Unusual sudo activity may be flagged.
* **Raw Log Events:** Shows sudo usage events.
* **Cyber Risk Scores:** Minor increase in risk if excessive.

---

### **C. Malicious File Detection**

**Scenario:** Place an EICAR test file (harmless anti-virus test file) on the system.

**How to execute:**

```bash
echo "X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*" > ~/eicar.txt
```

**What should be logged:**

* If Filebeat/Auditbeat is monitoring home or system directories, file creation events logged.

**Expected in Kibana:**

* **Raw Log Events:** Detects file creation.
* **Threat Intelligence Feeds:** If your threat intelligence includes EICAR hash, should trigger match.
* **Security Notifications & Alerts:** Possible alert on detection.

---

### **D. Simulate Vulnerability Scan**

**Scenario:** Run OpenVAS or Nmap scan against Worker 1.

**How to execute:**

```bash
# On another machine:
nmap -sS -A 192.168.43.187
# Or schedule/run an OpenVAS scan
```

**What should be logged:**

* `/var/log/auth.log` (suspicious connections), `/var/log/syslog`
* OpenVAS or Vulnerability scan results ingested into platform

**Expected in Kibana:**

* **Openvas Results / Vulnerability Scan Results:** New scan entries.
* **Anomaly Detections (AI/ML):** Unusual network activity detected.
* **Security Notifications & Alerts:** Alert if open ports or vulnerabilities found.
* **Cyber Risk Scores:** Risk increases based on new findings.

---

### **E. Simulate Threat Intelligence Hit**

**Scenario:** Curl to a known malicious domain/IP in your threat intelligence.

**How to execute:**

```bash
curl http://malicious-domain.test # Replace with a domain/IP from your threat feed
```

**What should be logged:**

* Outbound HTTP request logged (if network monitoring or Filebeat monitors web requests).
* Threat Intel correlation in platform.

**Expected in Kibana:**

* **Threat Intelligence Feeds:** Indicator match with test domain/IP.
* **Security Notifications & Alerts:** Threat detected in logs.
* **Log Analysis Results:** Network connection logged and correlated.
* **Cyber Risk Scores:** Asset risk increases due to confirmed contact with known threat.

---

### **F. Simulate Service Failure**

**Scenario:** Stop an essential service to simulate downtime.

**How to execute:**

```bash
sudo systemctl stop filebeat
```

**What should be logged:**

* `/var/log/syslog` and system logs register service stop.
* Platform detects health degradation.

**Expected in Kibana:**

* **Service Health Status:** Alerts for service not running.
* **Security Notifications & Alerts:** Notification/alert generated for service interruption.

---

## **2. Validation & Checking the Data Views**

After running each scenario above:

1. **Open each Data View** in Kibana as shown in your screenshots.
2. For each scenario, validate:

   * **Event visibility:** The right log entries/events appear in the corresponding view.
   * **Detection/Alerting:** AI/ML/anomaly modules produce alerts or flag activity.
   * **Correlation:** Threat intelligence matches, vulnerabilities, and risk scores are updated.
   * **Dashboard update:** Service health reflects status, compliance views update as appropriate.

---

## **3. Additional Recommendations**

* **Automate Testing:** Use scripts to automate common test scenarios for future regression/acceptance testing.
* **Review Alerts:** Ensure alerting is enabled and notifications are correctly sent (email, Slack, etc.).
* **Tune Anomaly Models:** After testing, review false positives/negatives and tune thresholds or retrain models as needed.
* **Log Rotation:** Check that logs are rotated and not filling the disk.
* **Documentation:** Record each test, outcome, screenshot, and any issue for your validation report.

B. Sudo Abuse / Privilege Escalation — Step-by-Step Test Scenario
Certainly! Here’s a **step-by-step guide to simulate and test “B. Sudo Abuse / Privilege Escalation”** in your environment, specifying on which machine (Worker 1, Server, or Kali) each step should be performed. The goal is to **generate logs that will be captured and monitored in your ELK Stack for security monitoring**.

---

## **B. Sudo Abuse / Privilege Escalation — Step-by-Step Test Scenario**

---

### **Scenario Summary**

A user with sudo access attempts to escalate privileges and execute administrative commands—possibly in an unauthorized or suspicious way. You want to simulate this and verify that such activity is logged and visible in your SIEM.

---

### **1. Preparation**

#### **On Worker 1 (Target)**



#### **Step 1: (Kali → Worker 1) SSH into Worker 1 as a normal user**

```bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.43.187
```

*(replace IP/user as needed)*

---

#### **Step 2: (Worker 1) Run Suspicious Sudo Commands**

Once logged in (directly or via SSH), execute commands that typically require elevated privileges.
Use a mix of normal and suspicious commands to test logging and SIEM visibility.

##### **Examples:**

* **a. List root directory**

  ```bash
  sudo ls /root
  ```

* **b. Try editing sensitive files (e.g., passwd)**

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/passwd
  ```

* **c. Try creating a new user**

  ```bash
  sudo useradd hackeruser
  sudo passwd hackeruser
  ```

* **d. Escalate to a full root shell**

  ```bash
  sudo su -
  ```

* **e. Deliberately fail a sudo attempt (wrong password)**

  ```bash
  sudo -k  # invalidate credentials
  sudo ls /root
  # (enter wrong password several times)
  ```

---

#### **Step 3: (Worker 1) View Logs Locally (Optional, for Verification)**

Check what’s being logged:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

---







---

## **1. Backup the Original File (Critical!)**

```bash
sudo cp /etc/passwd /etc/passwd.bak
```

---

## **2. Simulate Malicious Edit**

You have several safe options. Here’s an example:

* **Add a harmless comment at the end of `/etc/passwd`:**

```bash
sudo sh -c "echo '# test sudo abuse' >> /etc/passwd"
```

Or, to simulate a real attack (without actual harm), **add a fake user line at the end** (which the system will ignore since it doesn’t match the required fields, but will still be logged):

```bash
sudo sh -c "echo 'hackeruser:x:1337:1337::/home/hackeruser:/bin/bash' >> /etc/passwd"
```

* *This will log a sudo action and file modification, but won’t impact actual system users unless you try to log in as that user (which you should not do for safety).*

---

## **3. (Optional) Verify the Edit**

```bash
tail /etc/passwd
```

You should see your test line at the bottom.

---

## **4. Observe Logs in Kibana**

* **Search for keywords**: `sudo`, `passwd`, `nano`, `echo`, `hackeruser`, etc.
* **Time range**: Right after your edit.

---

## **5. Restore the Original `/etc/passwd` File**

Once testing is done and you’ve verified log generation in Kibana, **restore the original file** to remove your test entries:

```bash
sudo mv /etc/passwd.bak /etc/passwd
```

---

| Step        | Command                                                                                 | Effect                    | How to Restore |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| Backup      | `sudo cp /etc/passwd /etc/passwd.bak`                                                   | Saves original            | —              |
| Edit (test) | `sudo sh -c "echo 'hackeruser:x:1337:1337::/home/hackeruser:/bin/bash' >> /etc/passwd"` | Adds line (triggers logs) |                |
| Verify      | `tail /etc/passwd`                                                                      | See the test line         |                |
| Restore     | `sudo mv /etc/passwd.bak /etc/passwd`                                                   | Restore clean state       | —              |

C. Malicious File Detection – Step-by-Step Test Guide


## 1. **Correct Way to Create the Malicious Script**



```bash
printf '#!/bin/bash\necho Malicious activity detected\n' > /home/ubuntu/security-solution-worker/logs/malicious.sh
chmod +x /home/ubuntu/security-solution-worker/logs/malicious.sh
```

### **Or, temporarily disable history expansion:**

```bash
set +H
echo -e "#!/bin/bash\necho Malicious activity detected" > /home/ubuntu/security-solution-worker/logs/malicious.sh
chmod +x /home/ubuntu/security-solution-worker/logs/malicious.sh
```

---

## 2. **Test the Script (Generate Activity)**

```bash
bash /home/ubuntu/security-solution-worker/logs/malicious.sh
```

This will output `Malicious activity detected`—you should now have *two* malicious files in your logs folder for Filebeat to pick up.

---

## 3. **Filebeat Logging**

The path for Filebeat logs might be different on your system (often `/var/log/filebeat/filebeat.log` or `/var/log/filebeat.log`).
You can try:

```bash
sudo find /var/log -name 'filebeat*'
```

Or check logs directly via `journalctl`:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u filebeat -f
```

But, **Filebeat service is running**, so the files you created should be shipped to Logstash/Elasticsearch.

---



```bash
rm /home/ubuntu/security-solution-worker/logs/eicar_test.log
rm /home/ubuntu/security-solution-worker/logs/malicious.sh
```
